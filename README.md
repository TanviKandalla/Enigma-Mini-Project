# Enigma-Mini-Project:
Our project is a python application that can convert nearly 20 currencies interchangeably based on the user's requirements. This application runs on any operating system, and uses text-based inputs from the user. <br>
We have used classes to accomplish this, in order to enable easy updating of our data with new currencies. The standard currency we have chosen to facilitate the conversions is Indian Rupees. <br>
